The user will get 5 chances to guess a 5 letter word.
If the word is correct then - you win the game.
If the word is incorrect - the game will tell you many letters of the word you guessed correctly and incorrectly and if the letter is at its correct position in the word or not.

Misplaced letters tell you the letters which are present in the word but are wrongly placed in the word you guessed.
Incorrect letters are the letters which are not present in the correct word.

The user loses the game if they cannot guess the word within 5 chances.
